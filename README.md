Cyan's Minecraft server is a vanilla survival Minecraft server created since Minecraft 1.16.4 (The Nether Update!) It is mainly used for Cyan's streams and for fans to gather and have some fun!

The server has **online mode on** and a whitelist based on the in-game name. To join the server, read the rules and participate in Cyan's discussion groups.

## Rules

1. **Be respectful to other players.** We want the server to be fun and safe so abusing or disrespecting other players is not allowed. Political discussions are also discouraged. Examples of disrespectful behaviors include:
    * Discrimination
    * Advertising
    * Spamming
    * Constant cursing
    * Trolling players
    * Discussing inappropriate topics

2. **No griefing.** Respect other player's builds and items and never intentionally destroy them. Don't do the following:
    * Destruction of structures built or owned, by other players.
    * Opening chests in another player's base without permission.
    * Stealing other players' items.
    * Repeatedly harming/killing other players.

3. **No server exploits.** Use of hacked clients or exploiting any server or Minecraft bugs is not allowed. Most client mods are allowed but they should not alter vanilla gameplay mechanics or use too much server resources. Examples of hacks not allowed on the server:
    * Fastbreak/Fastplace
    * Speed/Fly/Highjump/Vehicle flight
    * ForceField/MultiAura
    * Criticals
    * NoKnockback
    * NoFall
    * NoSlowdown
    * Jesus
    * Step/Spider

4. Builds or entities that impact the server performance or cause lags to other players may be asked to remove.

## Build protection

The server has a protection plugin to protect Cyan's builds and streams. Build is only permitted in certain allowed areas listed below. Players receive invincibility outside the build area but cannot interact with the world. If you are stuck outside build area and cannot go back, either use `/suicide` (drops all items and cannot pick up) or contact admin.

Allowed build areas:
* Overworld:
    * (x=2048,z=2048) ~ (x=4096,z=4096)
* Nether:
    * (x=256,z=256) ~ (x=2048,z=2048)
* The End: currently disabled (portals will not work).
