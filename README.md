Cyan's Minecraft server is a vanilla survival Minecraft server created since Minecraft 1.16.4 (The Nether Update!) It is mainly used for Cyan's streams and for fans to gather and have some fun!

The server has **online mode on** and a whitelist based on the in-game name. To join the server, read the rules and participate in Cyan's discussion groups.

## Rules

1. **Be respectful to other players.** We want the server to be fun and safe so abusing or disrespecting other players is not allowed. Political discussions are also discouraged. Examples of disrespectful behaviors include:
    * Discrimination
    * Advertising
    * Spamming
    * Constant cursing
    * Trolling players
    * Discussing inappropriate topics

2. **No griefing.** Respect other player's builds and items and never intentionally destroy them. Don't do the following:
    * Destruction of structures built or owned, by other players.
    * Opening chests in another player's base without permission.
    * Stealing other players' items.
    * Repeatedly harming/killing other players.

3. **No server exploits.** Use of any server or Minecraft bugs is no allowed. Most client mods are allowed. **[Read here](hacks.md) if you plan to use hacked clients**. General rules about modding:
    * Respect vanilla players.
    * No significant advantages over other players.
    * Make sure the server runs smoothly for all players.

4. Builds or entities that impact the server performance or cause lags to other players may be asked to remove.

## Build protection

The server has a protection plugin to protect Cyan's builds and streams. Build is only permitted in certain allowed areas listed below. Players receive invincibility outside the build area but cannot interact with the world. If you are stuck outside build area and cannot go back, either use `/suicide` (drops all items and cannot pick up) or contact admin.

Allowed build areas:
* Overworld:
    * (x=2000,z=2000) ~ (x=4096,z=4096)
    * Spawn: (x=2970,z=2874)
* Nether:
    * (x=0,z=0) ~ (x=2048,z=2048)
* The End: Open to all

Warning: In the overworld, the build region border will not extend to X,Z < 2000 unless we decide to do so. Items thrown outside the border cannot be picked up, and blocks beyond the border cannot be mined. You cannot ask an admin to get items or mine blocks outside the border.

Depending on player activities, build region may extend beyond X,Z > 4096 in the future.

## Members

If you are a vtuber or streamer and wish to stream or record on the server, collab with Cyan, or just have some fun with other streamers, you may gain the member rank with the following differences:

* Not restricted by build protection.
* Spawn at the world spawn (near 0,0)

Please still follow the rules and keep the following in mind:

* No griefing or trolling other streamers.
* Do not travel too far (>10k blocks on any axis) to keep the world file reasonably small.
