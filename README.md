Cyan's Minecraft server is a vanilla survival Minecraft server created since Minecraft 1.16.4 (The Nether Update!) It is mainly used for Cyan's streams and for fans to gather and have some fun!

The server has **online mode on** and a whitelist based on the in-game name. To join the server, read the rules and participate in Cyan's discussion groups.

If you play **Bedrock Edition (mobile/console)**, read the Bedrock Edition section.

## Rules

1. **Be respectful to other players.** We want the server to be fun and safe so abusing or disrespecting other players is not allowed. Political discussions are also discouraged. Examples of disrespectful behaviors include:
    * Discrimination
    * Advertising
    * Spamming
    * Constant cursing
    * Trolling players
    * Discussing inappropriate topics

2. **No griefing.** Respect other player's builds and items and never intentionally destroy them. Don't do the following:
    * Destruction of structures built or owned, by other players.
    * Opening chests in another player's base without permission.
    * Stealing other players' items.
    * Repeatedly harming/killing other players.

3. **No server exploits.** Use of any server or Minecraft bugs is not allowed. Client mods are allowed. **[Read here](hacks.md) for hacked clients**. General rules about modding:
    * Respect vanilla players.
    * No significant advantages over other players.
    * Make sure the server runs smoothly for all players.

4. Builds or entities that impact the server performance or cause lags to other players may be asked to remove.

## Build protection

The server has a protection plugin to protect Cyan's builds and streams. Build is suggested in certain allowed areas listed below.

Suggested build areas:
* Overworld:
    * (x=2000,z=2000) ~ (x=8000,z=8000)
    * Spawn: (x=2970,z=2874)
* Nether:
    * (x=-300,z=-300) ~ (x=4000,z=4000)
* The End: Open to all

The suggestion is set in order to keep the world file reasonably small, and prepare for future upgrades.

## Members

If you are a vtuber or streamer and wish to stream or record on the server, collab with Cyan, or just have some fun with other streamers, you may gain the member rank with the following differences:

* Not restricted by build protection.
* Spawn at the world spawn (near 0,0)

Please still follow the rules and keep the following in mind:

* No griefing or trolling other streamers.
* Do not travel too far (>10k blocks on any axis) to keep the world file reasonably small.

## Bedrock Edition

The server allows connection from Bedrock Edition via [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/). It is a protocol translator, meaning the backend server is still Java Edition, but will allow Bedrock Edition to connect.

**You still need a Java Edition account to join!** Bedrock Edition compatibility is experimental and may be unstable.

IP: mc.cyannyan.net
Port: 19132 (default)

## Alts

Server will accept alts from https://ely.by. These are not official accounts! Other online mode servers won't accept them. You need to use a compatible launcher ([HMCL](https://github.com/huanghongxun/HMCL)) with authlib-injector.

**You need to already have a Java Edition account from Mojang!** Cracked games will not be supported.
