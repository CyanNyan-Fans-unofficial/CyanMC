# Hacked clients

We do not encourage the use of any hacked clients (or cheat clients, utility mods). If you are not familiar with them, please do not use them. Many downloads contain viruses and even backdoors that upload passwords or login tokens of your minecraft, discord and other accounts.

If you are familiar with hacked clients and often play with it, please be careful when using it. This is not an anarchy server! If basic rules are not followed, or if other players complain about cheating and ruining the fun, **You will be banned from the server.**
* Always verify the source before downloading and installing anything.
* Respect other players because not everyone likes cheating.
* Don't ruin the fun of others by griefing or lagging the server.
* Don't collect an excessive amount of resources. Please keep the game balanced for everyone.
* Don't combat players using hacks.
* Don't travel too far away (>10k blocks) to keep the server map reasonably small.
* Never encourage other players to use hacked clients. (Discussion on discord is allowed.)



The server has an [anticheat plugin](https://matrix.rip) that block many forms of hacks. Try turning off these functions if you are unable to move or perform certain actions. **Blocked hacks examples**:

* Fastbreak/Fastplace
* Speed/Fly/Highjump/Vehicle flight
* ForceField/MultiAura
* Criticals
* NoKnockback
* NoFall
* NoSlowdown
* Jesus
* Step/Spider
